<h2>Creating, opening and saving tables</h2>

<div class="post">
<p><br></p>

<h4>Creating a table from scratch</h4>

<p>When claimtracker first starts, a blank, untitled table opens in a new tab, which
by default is set to track Yukon claims.  To change the table&#39;s settings, including
the province/state where the claims are registered, this file must first be saved.</p>

<h4>Saving a table</h4>

<p>Entries are saved in a comma-seperated-values file (.csv), which can be opened in
Microsoft Excel or a text editor.  In addition, an initialization file (.ini) will
be saved in the same directory, which contains configuration values and maps the
required categories to the columns in the file.  Each file will contain at least
eight categories in eight columns, which occupy the first row.  The categories are:
Group, Tenure ID, Tenure Name, Owner, Issue Date, Expiry Date, Last Updated and
Comments.  If you are saving a new file, then these categories will be filled
automatically.  If you have opened a file containing columns that correlate with
these columns, then upon saving, these columns will be mapped to the required
categories.  If the file does not have a column that correlates with one of the
eight categories, then a new column will be added to the file.</p>

<p>To save a file, select File&gt;&gt;Save Table from the menu.</p>

<h4>Adding to the table</h4>

<p>To add an entry to a table in claimtracker, right click a row and select &#39;new&#39;.
Columns that can be modified are: Group, Tenure ID and Comments.  A valid Tenure ID
is required to update the claim information.  Alternativley, entries can be added
to the file in Microsoft Excel or any other external editor.</p>

<h4>Opening a table for the first time</h4>

<p>When claimtracker opens a file for the first time, it will present you with a
dialog to map the file&#39;s columns to the eight claimtracker categories.  One
column must be mapped to proceed, to any category.  The import wizard dialog is
shown in the screenshot below:

<br><br>
In addition, the dialog presents an option to select which state or province
tenures are located in.  It is important to select the right jursidiction, because
each one has a specific method for fetching data.</p>

<h4>Modifying a table</h4>

<p>It is possible to modify the table&#39;s mapping, or change the table&#39;s jurisdiction, by
selecting File&gt;&gt;Import Wizard from the menu.</p>
