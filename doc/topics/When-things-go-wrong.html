<h2>When things go wrong</h2>

<div class="post">
<p>Claimtracker maintains a log file (claimtracker.log) in the same directory where
the executable resides. There are five levels of detail that claimtracker can log,
which determines what events are recorded in the log file. The granularity can be
selected in Edit&gt;&gt;Preferences, and the five levels are:
<br><br>
<em>DEBUG</em> - used for interal system events that are not necessarily observable from the
application but are useful to trace the steps leading to an event.
<br><br>
<em>INFO</em> - used to describe services starting and stopping, or to provide information
about the state of the application.
<br><br>
<em>WARNING</em> - used to describe mis-behaving but recoverable events in the software, such
as malformed inputs and outputs.
<br><br>
<em>ERROR</em> - used to describe non-critical errors that break functionality, such as the
inability to update claims.
<br><br>
<em>CRITICAL</em> - used to describe fatal events that is forcing the shutdown of the service
or application.
<br><br>
By default, the claimtracker logging level is set to <em>DEBUG</em>, and it is recommended to
leave the software at this level while it is being actively developed.
<br><br>
In the event of unexpected behaviour or critical failures, please email
<a href="mailto:jhm@jemscout.com">jhm@jemscout.com</a> with a thorough
descriptions of the events leading to the bug and the log file attached.</p>
