v 0.9.3

*claimtracker* organizes and updates mineral tenure information for claims
registered in British Columbia, Nevada and the Yukon.  Tenure information is
stored as a human-readable database, and simply clicking 'Update All' will
update the name, ownership, issue date and, most importantly, the expiry date
of mineral claims.

### Installation ###

This software is designed for Windows, and compilation/installation is left 
as an exercise to the reader. I do recall having to patch the selenium python
module in order to prevent it from popping open a console window every time
the driver is used. Some information on how to do this can be found
[here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33983860)

### Usage/Help ###

Please refer to the included [documentation](doc) for usage information.
